# mobile_parent_child

This solution consists of 3 custom code actions and three workflows. 

The custom code actions and the associated workflows are included in this repository (the workflows are included as PNG images, which you can recreate in your own HubSpot portal and the custom code actions are included as node.js code). 

For all of the workflows, make sure to turn re-enrollment ON. 

Please make sure to test this in a sandbox environment before turning on in a live environment; all code is provided as-is.
